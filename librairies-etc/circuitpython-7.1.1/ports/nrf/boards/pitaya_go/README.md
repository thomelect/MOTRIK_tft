## Installing CircuitPython submodules

Before you can build, you will need to run the following commands once, which
will install the submodules that are part of the CircuitPython ecosystem, and
build the `mpy-cross` tool:

```
$ cd circuitpython
$ git submodule update --init
$ make -C mpy-cross
```


## Building
```sh
$ cd ports/nrf
$ make BOARD=pitaya_go SD=s140 -V=1 -j4
```
