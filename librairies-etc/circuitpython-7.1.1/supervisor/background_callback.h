/** Background callbacks are a linked list of tasks to call in the background.
 *
 * Include a member of type `background_callback_t` inside an object
 * which needs to queue up background work, and zero-initialize it.
 *
 * To schedule the work, use background_callback_add, with fun as the
 * function to call and data pointing to the object itself.
 *
 * Next time run_background_tasks_if_tick is called, the callback will
 * be run and removed from the linked list.
 *
 * Queueing a task that is already queued does nothing.  Unconditionally
 * re-queueing it from its own background task will cause it to run during the
 * very next background-tasks invocation, leading to a CircuitPython freeze, so
 * don't do that.
 *
 * background_callback_add can be called from interrupt context.
