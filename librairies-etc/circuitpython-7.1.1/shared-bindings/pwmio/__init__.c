//| """Support for PWM based protocols
//|
//| The `pwmio` module contains classes to provide access to basic pulse IO.
//|

//| All classes change hardware state and should be deinitialized when they
//| are no longer needed if the program continues after use. To do so, either
//| call :py:meth:`!deinit` or use a context manager. See
//| :ref:`lifetime-and-contextmanagers` for more info.
//|
//| For example::
//|
//|   import time
//|   import pwmio
//|   import board
//|
//|   pwm = pwmio.PWMOut(board.LED)
//|   pwm.duty_cycle = 2 ** 15
//|   time.sleep(0.1)
//|
//| This example will initialize the the device, set
//| :py:data:`~pwmio.PWMOut.duty_cycle`, and then sleep 0.1 seconds.
//| CircuitPython will automatically turn off the PWM when it resets all
//| hardware after program completion. Use ``deinit()`` or a ``with`` statement
//| to do it yourself."""
