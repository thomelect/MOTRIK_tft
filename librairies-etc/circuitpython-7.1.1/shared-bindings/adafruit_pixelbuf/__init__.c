//| """A fast RGB(W) pixel buffer library for like NeoPixel and DotStar
//|
//| The `adafruit_pixelbuf` module provides the :py:class:`PixelBuf` class to accelerate
//| RGB(W) strip/matrix manipulation, such as DotStar and Neopixel.
//|
//| Also available as ``_pixelbuf``. This usage has been deprecated.
//|
//| Byteorders are configured with strings, such as "RGB" or "RGBD"."""
